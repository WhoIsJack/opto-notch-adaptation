# opto-notch-adaptation

This repo hosts the code for the quantitative image analysis and Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) modelling in the paper **"Desensitisation of Notch signalling through dynamic adaptation in the nucleus"** by Viswanathan, Hartmann and colleagues. All code was written by Jonas Hartmann.


### Repository Structure

- `Notebooks/` is where most of the important code is.
  - `DEV`: Initial development of image quantification pipelines.
  - `RUN`: Batch execution of the image quantification pipelines.
  - `ANA`: Downstream analysis of quantified image data.
  - `MOD`: The ODE modelling and its analysis.
- `optonotch/` is a package into which some frequently used functions have been refactored.
  - `optonotch.utilities`: Various utilities used in various places.
  - `optonotch.modeling`: Data loading, input functions and loss functions for the modelling.
- `Data/` houses the data used.
  - `Images/`: Input image data. Required only for `DEV` and `RUN` notebooks. Not hosted on GitHub due to file size; please contact Jonas Hartmann for more information.
  - `Measurements/`: Derived values. Required for `ANA` and `MOD` notebooks. Included in this repository.
- `Figures/`: Figures generated by the code. 
  - These are "raw" plots used for figure construction; composition, axis labels and other annotations may be slightly different in the published paper figures.
- `Illustrations/` contain some images used in markdown annotations in some places.


### Data Flow

1. Raw images were prepared by z-projection where appropriate.

2. `RUN` notebooks ingest images and produce measurements.

3. `ANA` notebooks produce figures from these measurements.

  - `ANA - sim spot detection.ipynb` also generates and saves a cleaned version of some measurements for use in modelling!
  - `ANA - nuclear nicd bleaching.ipynb` also infers the bleaching constant of mCherry for use in fitting the NICD import-export models.

  - `ANA - nuclear nicd measurement.ipynb` also fits NICD import-export models for use in modelling!

4. `MOD` notebooks fit the various models that were tested and produce figures from them.
